<h1>This is a very complicated project</h1>

<h2>This project will attempt to create a text based version of keyforge. If things go real well, I may attempt online play, a simple ai, and a graphical version, but I've got a lot of work ahead of me.<h2>
<h3>Current Goals:</h3>
 - <s>Be able to import and save decks</s> - <b>Done</b>
 - <s>Create initial game setup:</s>
   - <s>Choosing which decks to play</s> - <b>Done</b>
   - <s>Deciding who goes first</s> - <b>Done</b>
   - <s>Drawing up to a full hand</s> - <b>Done</b>
   - <s>Playing the first turn (because it has its own special requirements)</s> - <b>Done</b>
 - Create the turn, including:
   - <s>Forge a key</s>- <b>Done</b>
   - <s>Choose a house</s> - <b>Done</b>
     - <u>At this point they may pick up their archive</u>
   - Play, discard and use cards of the active house. Using includes:
     - Fighting
     - Reaping
     - Actions
   - <s>Ready Cards</s> - <b>Done</b>
   - <s>Draw Cards</s> - <b>Done</b>
- Write all the functions for all the cards, which will include a whole lot of states, so I'm also going to want to figure out a way for a game that is called to only pay attention to the relevant states.
- Rewrite the base code to reflect the implementation of the cards (ie in responses())
- update the play card function to tell the player how much amber they got for playing the card.
- Also, update it to make it more succinct (hint: use return statements?).
- need to implement hazardous and assault in fights
- need to implement upgrades (and then figure out how to work them into pending)
- figure out where destroyed abilities get called from <b>Answer can't be: from Card.update(). Why? Because sometimes cards can be destroyed other ways than damage.</b>
- write one-offs for Krump and creatures of his ilk
- the pending function will need to call card.dest, and definitely will need to call card.leaves

Bugs: extra armor is always applied, even if it's been broken

<h2>Card notes: (Cards I've implemented, w/ notes on implementation)</h2>

<h3>Randoms (one-offs that get their own special checks):</h3>
- 44: Rock-Hurling Giant - not sure I implemented this well
- 192: Ether Spider - won't have a state, will just check for it everytime amber is gained (event emitter?)
- 261: The Vaultkeeper
